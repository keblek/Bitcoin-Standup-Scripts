# DISCLAIMER: It is not a good idea to store large amounts of Bitcoin on a VPS,
# ideally you should use this as a watch-only wallet. This script is expiramental
# and has not been widely tested. The creators are not responsible for loss of
# funds. If you are not familiar with running a node or how Bitcoin works then we
# urge you to use this in testnet so that you can use it as a learning tool.

# This script installs the latest stable version of Bitcoin Core and ubuntu updates

# StandUp.sh will create two logs in your root directory, to read them run:
# $ cat standup.err
# $ cat standup.log

####
#0. Prerequisites
####

# In order to run this script you need to be logged in as root, and enter in the commands
# listed below:

# (the $ represents a terminal commmand prompt, do not actually type in a $)

# First you need to give the root user a password:
# $ sudo passwd

# Then you need to switch to the root user:
# $ su - root

# Then create the file for the script:
# $ nano standup.sh

# Nano is a text editor that works in a terminal
# Replace the version number for Bitcoin Core 
# then you can type:
# control x (this starts to exit nano)
# y (this confirms you want to save the file)
# return (just press enter to confirm you want to save and exit)

# Then we need to make sure the script can be executable with:
# $ chmod +x standup.sh

# After that you can run the script with the optional arguments like so:
# $ ./standup.sh "insert pubkey" "insert node type (see options below)" "insert ssh key" "insert ssh allowed IP's" "insert password for standup user"


# Force check for root, if you are not logged in as root then the script will not execute
if ! [ "$(id -u)" = 0 ]
then
